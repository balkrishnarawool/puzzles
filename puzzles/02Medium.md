Medium Complexity Puzzle

Your input has a long list of numbers. There is only one pair that adds up to 1000. Find out that pair.
The answer to this puzzle is product of those numbers.

For example, if your input is as below:
```
105
204
303
402
601
399
525
675
750
815
```
Here the only pair that adds to 1000 is 601 and 399.
